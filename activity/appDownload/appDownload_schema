You will require one browser and microphone supporting device to conduct sessions and a SEPARATE iOS device to operate the Mumble Melody app.<br><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alishakodibagkar/MumbleMelody_Longitudinal_Baseline/master/protocol/image_2.png\" width=100%><br><br>STEP 3: Now, you can download the Mumble Melody app on your iOS device.<br>Go to your App store and search “Mumble Melody” OR follow the link tinyurl.com/mumblemelodyapp.<br>The app is currently being used specifically for research purposes, so the app has a limited time before it expires. If you have already downloaded Mumble Melody and the app is expired please email us. If you recently downloaded Mumble Melody, the app should remain active for the remainder of the study. If the app expires at any time during the study, please reach out to our team at mumblemelody@mit.edu<br><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alishakodibagkar/MumbleMelody_Longitudinal_Baseline/master/protocol/image_3.png\" width=100%"><br><br>STEP 4: Once the app has been downloaded on your device, plug in your Apple headphones into your device. For the iPhone, this means you will attach the lightning to headphone jack adapter to your headphones, and then plug them into your device. For the Mac and iPad, this means you will plug in the headphones directly into your device. Wear the headphones.<br><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alishakodibagkar/MumbleMelody_Longitudinal_Baseline/master/protocol/image_4.png\" width=100%><br><br>STEP5 5: Now we will explore the Mumble Melody app. When you enter the app for the first time, you will be asked to read and complete an onboarding form. Then, you will see the home page with 3 settings - the Modes page, the About page, and the Get Involved page.  When you click the Modes page, you should see the 4 different altered auditory feedback sections that we provide. Please don’t use them yet. If the modes appear to not be working (in which case you will get a pop-up notification or the modes will be greyed out), make sure your headphones are plugged into the device.<br><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alishakodibagkar/MumbleMelody_Longitudinal_Baseline/master/protocol/image_5.png\" width=100%><br><br>STEP 6: Next, click on the Modes page and click on Unaltered. Take a moment to turn the “Unaltered” mode on, test it by repeating a few words out loud (for example, “Testing 1, 2, 3”), and adjust your volume button until you comfortably can hear your voice in your headphones. The “Unaltered” mode will play back your unaltered voice. Try to refrain from using the other modes.<br><br>STEP 7: This is the final step. Answer the question below to input your app ID.",
